---------------- Matlab functions -------------------
[adj nodeList] = createTopGrap(file)

Takes a text-file with graph connections on format
A B
A C
B C
...
and creates one matrix adj, and one cell array nodeList.
nodeList is a conversion table between the literals A,B,C
to numbers 1,2,3 etc.
adj holds the graph structure. It is a NxN matrix with ones
for pairs of nodes that are connected



nodeAttributes = readAttributes(file,nodeVals)

Takes a text-file with node attributes and stores in a matrix
The file should be on the format
A 1 2 3
B 2 3 1
C 3 1 2
...
where the literal denotes the node id and the numerals the
attribute values. A matrix nodeAttributes is returned
where each row of numerals in the text file corresponds
to one row in the matrix according to a lookup given
by the nodeVals parameter
