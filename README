For this to work all folders of the UGM-library needs to be in the MATLAB-path

---------------- Matlab functions -------------------
[graphStruct nodePot edgePot] = main( id )

Takes an id of the floor plan and creates a graph with corresponding
structure. Running
labels = UGM_Decode_MaxOfMarginals(nodePot,edgePot,edgeStruct,@UGM_Infer_LBP);
will generate a labeling, and
 graphViz4Matlab('-adjMat',edgeStruct.adj, '-nodeLabels', edgeStruct.labels, '-undirected', true, '-nodeColors', clrs,'-types',labels);
will draw the graph. This graph will have the ground truth in text, and assigned labels as colors. For correctly colored labels, run
labelGraph = createLabelGraph( edgeStruct.classes );
graphViz4Matlab('-adjMat',labelGraph.adj, '-nodeLabels', labelGraph.labels, '-undirected', true, '-nodeColors', clrs,'-types',labelGraph.types);


[adj nodeList] = createTopGrap(file)

Takes a text-file with graph connections on format
A B
A C
B C
...
and creates one matrix adj, and one cell array nodeList.
nodeList is a conversion table between the literals A,B,C
to numbers 1,2,3 etc.
adj holds the graph structure. It is a NxN matrix with ones
corresponding to pairs of nodes that are connected, and zeroes
otherwise.



nodeAttributes = readAttributes(file,nodeVals)

Takes a text-file with node attributes and stores in a matrix
The file should be on the format
A 1 2 3
B 2 3 1
C 3 1 2
...
where the literal denotes the node id and the numerals the
attribute values. A matrix nodeAttributes is returned
where each row of numerals in the text file corresponds
to one row in the matrix according to a lookup given
by the nodeVals parameter.
